tldr: "Deployed a large language model (LLM) application as a secure, scalable cloud service using FastAPI and Google Cloud."
problem: |
  Businesses wanted to quickly integrate generative AI into workflows but lacked expertise to securely deploy and operate LLMs at scale in the cloud.
tech_stack:
  - FastAPI (Python)
  - HuggingFace Transformers
  - Google Cloud Functions
  - Cloud Run & IAM
  - Terraform (IaC)
  - Docker

contributions:
  - Built an API backend using FastAPI, optimizing request handling for LLM inference workloads.
  - Packaged LLMs and all serving dependencies as reproducible Docker images.
  - Automated infrastructure provisioning (network, auth, scaling) with Terraform on GCP.
  - Set up secure, cost-effective CI/CD for push-to-cloud deployment and model update workflow.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deliver a **production-ready LLM-powered application** as a REST API, enabling organizations to integrate state-of-the-art NLP into business products. The stack leverages FastAPI for efficient serving, GCP Cloud Run & Functions for scalable deployment, and end-to-end DevOps best practices for reproducibility and governance.

## Key Outcomes

- **Rapid prototyping to production:** Reduced time to deploy new LLM features from weeks to hours.
- **Cost optimization:** Leveraged serverless and managed compute for elastic scaling, minimizing idle costs.
- **Robust security:** Incorporated IAM and environment-based secret management to protect data and models.

## What I Did

- Led the design, implementation, and cloud automation of the app infrastructure.
- Integrated monitoring, observability, and automated rollback for reliability.
- Authored user/developer guides for internal adoption of the deployment pattern.
