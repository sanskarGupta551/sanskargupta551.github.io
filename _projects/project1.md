contributions:
  - Authored modular ML pipeline templates using Argo Workflows and Docker.
  - Automated model experiment tracking, validation, and rollout using MLflow and Kubernetes Jobs.
  - Established CI/CD for continuous integration, testing, and cloud deployment (GitHub Actions + GKE).
  - Improved model delivery times by 60% and reduced production incidents.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-grade MLOps pipeline** leveraging cloud-native orchestration (Kubernetes) and automated tracking/deployment (MLflow). The workflow eliminates manual handoffs by coordinating code changes, data validation, training, and automated deployment of models to a managed cloud cluster.

## Key Outcomes

- **Reduced operational toil** for ML engineers and data scientists.
- Enabled **repeatable, version-controlled model deployment** using best practices in CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code.
- Achieved **robust monitoring and rollback mechanisms** to ensure system reliability.

## What I Did

- Led design and end-to-end implementation of ML pipeline and infra.
- Authored all supporting documentation and CI/CD templates.
- Performed training and onboarding for stakeholders.
